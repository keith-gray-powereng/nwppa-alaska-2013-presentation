IEC 61850 Review
=================

The Standard
------------

* International Standard

  * Carries IEC name but is derived from work done in the US
    by IEEE/EPRI called UCA 2.0
  * 12+ Sections
  * Some sections are at Edition 1 and some are at Edition 2
  
The Standard (con't)
--------------------

* Covers wide range of topics

  * System and Project Management
  * Engineering Tools
  * Data Modeling
  * Hardware Requirements
  * Product Lifecycle
  * Conformance Testing
  * Communication Structure

* Related standards cover

  * Security
  * Switchgear
  * and more

Promise of IEC 61850
--------------------

* **Interoperability**
* **NOT** *Interchangeability*
* Copper Removal
* Design Time Reduction

Communication Structure
-----------------------

* Station Bus

  * SCADA Protocol (MMS)

    * Client-Server Model

  * Protection Protocol (GOOSE)

    * Peer-Peer Model

* Process Bus

  * Sampled Values (SMV)

Object Orientation
------------------

* Models substation apparatus as software models
* Standard naming convention

Protection (GOOSE)
------------------

* Generic Object Oriented Substation Event
* Unsolicited transmission of any IEC 61850 object (Analog and/or Binary)
* Peer-Peer
* Publish-Subscribe
* Directly from Application Layer to Data Link Layer

  * No TCP/UDP/IP
  * Direct Ethernet Protocol
  * FAST

GOOSE (con't)
-------------

* Messages repeated at regular interval
* Data change event causes message to be published immediately
* Repeated at gradually larger interval until steady state repeate time
  is reached
* Allows *Virtual Wire Monitoring*

Engineering Process
-------------------

* Multiple steps
* Iterative
* Multiple software applications
* Defined in Section 6 of the IEC 61850 Standard

Process Overview
----------------

#. IED configuration tool provides a template file for each IED
#. System configuration tool imports all IED template files
#. Egnineer performs GOOSE configuration in the system configuration tool
#. System configuration tool exports the substation configuration file
#. IED configuration tool imports the substation configuration file and
   sends the IED configuration to each IED

Substation Configuration Language
---------------------------------

ICD - IED Configuration Description
  The ICD file is a template file for each IED. It can be provided by
  the IED vendor or generated by the IED itself.

CID - Configured IED Description
  The CID file describes the configuration of the IED after the Engineering
  process has occured. This file is generated by the IED
  configuration tool. It is sent to the relay for final programming.

SCD - Substation Configuration Description
  The SCD file describes the configuration of the entire substation after
  the engineering process has occurred. It is generated by the substation
  configuration tool.

IID, SSD, IED are less used file types defined in the standard.
