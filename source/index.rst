IEC 61850 Review
=================

The Standard
------------

* International Standard

  * Carries IEC name but is derived from work done in the US
    by IEEE/EPRI called UCA 2.0
  * 12+ Sections
  * Some sections are at Edition 1 and some are at Edition 2
  
The Standard (con't)
--------------------

* Covers wide range of topics

  * System and Project Management
  * Engineering Tools
  * Data Modeling
  * Hardware Requirements
  * Product Lifecycle
  * Conformance Testing
  * Communication Structure

* Related standards cover

  * Security
  * Switchgear
  * and more

Promise of IEC 61850
--------------------

* **Interoperability**
* **NOT** *Interchangeability*
* Copper Removal
* Design Time Reduction

Communication Structure
-----------------------

* Station Bus

  * SCADA Protocol (MMS)

    * Client-Server Model

  * Protection Protocol (GOOSE)

    * Peer-Peer Model

* Process Bus

  * Sampled Values (SMV)

Object Orientation
------------------

* Models substation apparatus as software models
* Standard naming convention

Protection (GOOSE)
------------------

* Generic Object Oriented Substation Event
* Unsolicited transmission of any IEC 61850 object (Analog and/or Binary)
* Peer-Peer
* Publish-Subscribe
* Directly from Application Layer to Data Link Layer

  * No TCP/UDP/IP
  * Direct Ethernet Protocol
  * FAST

GOOSE (con't)
-------------

* Messages repeated at regular interval
* Data change event causes message to be published immediately
* Repeated at gradually larger interval until steady state repeate time
  is reached
* Allows *Virtual Wire Monitoring*

Engineering Process
-------------------

* Multiple steps
* Iterative
* Multiple software applications
* Defined in Section 6 of the IEC 61850 Standard

Process Overview
----------------

#. IED configuration tool provides a template file for each IED
#. System configuration tool imports all IED template files
#. Egnineer performs GOOSE configuration in the system configuration tool
#. System configuration tool exports the substation configuration file
#. IED configuration tool imports the substation configuration file and
   sends the IED configuration to each IED

Substation Configuration Language
---------------------------------

**ICD - IED Configuration Description**
  The ICD file is a template file for each IED. It can be provided by
  the IED vendor or generated by the IED itself.

**CID - Configured IED Description**
  The CID file describes the configuration of the IED after the Engineering
  process has occured. This file is generated by the IED
  configuration tool. It is sent to the relay for final programming.

**SCD - Substation Configuration Description**
  The SCD file describes the configuration of the entire substation after
  the engineering process has occurred. It is generated by the substation
  configuration tool.

IID, SSD, IED are less used file types defined in the standard.

Project Description
===================

Overall Project
---------------

* Industrial Facility
* Electric System Reliability Upgrade
* Onsite COGEN - Steam and Electricity
* Utility inter-tie substation at 46kV
* Main substation at 13.8kV
* Distribution centers at 4.16kV and 2.4kV
* COGEN connected at 13.8kV

Reliability Improvements
------------------------

* Separate the two COGEN units onto two buses
* Dual feed from the utility
* Main-tie-tie-Main at Main Substation
* Main-tie-Main at distribution substations
* Redundant feeds to load distribution centers

Scope
-----

* Substation Design
* Transmission Line Design
* Short-circuit and Arc Flash Studies -> Protective Relay Settings
* Facility wide Electrical SCADA system
* Communications Aided Scheme Design
* Field Commissioning

Communications Aided Schemes
----------------------------

* Breaker Failure
* Transfer Trip
* Islanding
* Remote Metering
* Remote Automatic and Manual Generator Synchronizing

Design Process
==============

Functional Specifications
-------------------------

* Each scheme is documentented in a separate functional specification
* How should the scheme work
* Transmit/Receive GOOSE message contents
* LED/Pushbutton/Display Message definitions
* Hardware I/O
* How should it fail
* SCADA
* Test Mode
* SER

GOOSE Mapping Spreadsheet
-------------------------

* Developed in two stages because the actual relay settings are not 
  known at this time

  #. Everything but specific relay word bits

     * In Parallel to the functional specification

  #. Relay word bits

     * After bits have been assigned by relay programmer

* Transmitting Relays on the left
* Receiving relays across the top
* Intersection shows the mapped data

Logic Diagrams
--------------

* Derived from the functional specification and GOOSE spreadsheet
* Visual description of the logic used in the Communications Aided Schemes
* Shows GOOSE transmit data and GOOSE receive data

SCD File Engineering
-----------------

* Derived from functional specification and GOOSE spreadsheet
* Perform GOOSE Mapping in Engineering Software

IED Configurations
--------------------

* Derived from functional specification, GOOSE spreadsheet, and logic 
  diagrams
* Also includes "normal" protection settings

Test Plans
----------

* Derived from functional specification and GOOSE spreadsheet
* Test normal and failure modes of operation
* May need separate test plans for bench test vs. field test
